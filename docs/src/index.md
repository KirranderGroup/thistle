# Thistle Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Thistle Julia utilities. Use the navigation
sidebar to explore available guides:

- **Numerics** explains the type aliases and core integration routines.
- **Kernel guides** groups the total and elastic scattering kernels with
  examples on small test geometries.
- **Scattering workflow** walks through the Julia translation of the
  `total_scattering_calculation` driver, including expected array shapes and a
  diagram of the threaded accumulation.
